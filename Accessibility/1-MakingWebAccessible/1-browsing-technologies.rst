Different Browsing Technologies
###############################

In a perfect world everyone would use the same web browser. We all know this is not
the case. Although there is a small group of common browsers like
Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari and Internet Explorer, they come in different
versions with different add-ons or plug-ins, and for multiple devices, such as
handhelds.

A web browser is only one technology. It will display a website on a screen
that may be very wide or very small, using a fast or slow Internet connection.

People with some disabilities are not using a regular web browser, but, for
instance, a screen reader. Make sure your website can be handled by these
technologies as well.

Different browsing technologies, each with their own accessibility requirements,
can include:

Lynx browser
  Text-only browser with no support for tables, CSS, images, JavaScript, Flash,
  audio, or video content
WebTV
  560px in width with horizontal scrolling not available
Screen reader
  Page content read aloud in the order it appears in the HTML document
Handheld device
  Very small screen with limited support for JavaScript and large images
Screen magnifier
  As few as three to four words may be able to appear on the screen at any one
  time
Slow connection (below 56kb)
  Users may turn off images to enable a faster download time
1600px screen width
  Very wide screen

This basically means that to ensure your website is accessible to everyone you
must provide alternatives.
