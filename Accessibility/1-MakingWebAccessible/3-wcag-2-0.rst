WCAG 2.0
########

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) documents explain how to make Web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Web "content" generally refers to the information in a Web page or Web application, including text, images, forms, sounds, and such.

.. note::

   With this document we do not intend to explain these WCAG documents in 
   detail, but will give you some guidelines how to meet these criteria within 
   TYPO3.

WCAG 2.0 has 12 guidelines that are organized under 4 principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. For each guideline, there are testable success criteria, which are at three levels: A, AA, and AAA.

Perceivable
***********

Web content is made available to the senses - sight, hearing, and/or touch

- 1.1 Text Alternatives: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content
- 1.2 Time-based Media: Provide alternatives for time-based media
- 1.3 Adaptable: Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure
- 1.4 Distinguishable: Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background

Operable
********

Interface forms, controls, and navigation are operable

- 2.1 Keyboard Accessible: Make all functionality available from a keyboard
- 2.2 Enough Time: Provide users enough time to read and use content
- 2.3 Seizures: Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures
- 2.4 Navigable: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are

Understandable
**************

Content and interface are understandable

- 3.1 Readable: Make text content readable and understandable
- 3.2 Predictable: Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways
- 3.3 Input Assistance: Help users avoid and correct mistakes

Robust
******

Content can be used reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies

- 4.1 Compatible: Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies
