HTML5
#####

A lot of people are wondering; "What is HTML5?". If you believe some articles,
HTML5 is a mixture of HTML, CSS and JavaScript APIs. Well, IT'S NOT!

HTML5 is HTML. HTML5 is, by all means, the next version of HTML. After native
HTML and xHTML split apart, there was a definitive difference in the way
browsers would render each type of HTML. This brought along with it a slew of
doctypes and unnecessary conventions that were specific to one or the other.
Now that xHTML has all but died many of its features and ideas have come back
into the native HTML strain with HTML5.

With the advent of Web 2.0, smartphones, and tablets, the once simple language
to run the web had turned into a fractured mess of plug-ins, protocols, codecs,
incompatible browsers, and incompatible platforms.

HTML5 is designed to fix all those problems in one grand transition to a
massively overhauled version of the webâ€™s most popular language: HTML. The new
version makes media, especially video, into a first class citizen, allowing
it to be streamed natively without fiddling with plug-ins or cycling through
browsers looking for one that works. It also adds true support for web
applications, knitting together the hodgepodge of applications environments
like JavaScript, Adobe Flash, and ActionScript into a unified and universal
environment built around an extended JavaScript and CSS.

Along with streaming media, the surge in print publications moving to the web is
one of the largest trends in online computing. Unfortunately web standards have
proven inadequate for the task, requiring the invention of specialized reader
front ends.

HTML5 adds native tags for common document structures including headers,
footers, sections, captions, and figures so that the browser itself will be
able to intelligently display multi-page documents without plug-ins or custom
applications. A publication will be able to create a single version of their
content and have it render effectively across every compliant browser and
platform, including phones and tablets. Using these new tags will improve the
semantics of your website.
