Four Easy Tips
##############

Use Alternative labels for images
*********************************

- Insert alternative text in the field labeled "Alternative labels" when you
  create "Images" or "Text & Images" content elements. You can find this field
  in the tab labeled "Images" under "Accessibility".
- The alternative label should describe the image.
- In the case where text in an image is used instead of true text, the
  alternative label should say exactly what the image does.
- In the rare instance in which an image is purely decorative, leave the field
  labeled "Alternative labels" empty to indicate that there is no meaning.
- When the field "Images" contains multiple images, make sure every image has
  its own "Alternative label", one per line following the order of the images
  (top to bottom).

Why this is important
=====================

The blind access the Web via screen readers, which are programs that read text
on Web pages aloud. Screen readers also read alternative labels in images. If an
alternative label is not used, the information conveyed by images is useless to
blind users.

Don't Use Bold for Headings
***************************

- Don't make text look like a heading by selecting it and applying the Bold
  icon in the Rich Text Editor (RTE) in the user interface.
- Instead, select the text and apply the correct heading level such as Heading
  1 (h1), Heading 2 (h2), or Heading 3 (h3).
- The text will still appear bold, but will also have the proper mark-up.

Why this is important
=====================

Keeping content and presentation separate has many advantages. Chief among them
is that properly marked up content can more easily be "understood" across a
variety of browsers and platforms. This includes the screen readers that the
blind use to access the Web.

Just as sighted users scan a web page by looking at headings and make decisions
on what content is of interest or of use to them, blind users can scan headings
via their screen readers, which understand proper HTML markup. For example, a
screen reader can be directed to scan for h2 or h3 designated headings.
However, copy that merely looks like a heading, but lacks proper markup, cannot
be singled out by screen readers.

Be Careful with Colored Text
****************************

- Don't use colored text as the sole means of conveying information. (e.g.
  don't only use red text to convey a warning)
- It's okay to use colored text if another means of conveying the information
  is also used. (e.g. making the text bold or italicized as well as
  red)
- Don't use colored text where it is likely to be confused with a hyperlink.
- Don't use colored text excessively as a means to draw attention or create
  interest.

Why this is important
=====================

Users who are color blind may not be able to discern that certain text is a
different color from the rest of the text on the page.

All users are annoyed by text that looks like a link but isn't. However, it is
especially troublesome for users with motor disabilities who use more
cumbersome assistive technology to navigate the web. Navigating to text that
looks like a link can be a much greater commitment on their time than for other
users.

Users with cognitive disabilities, such as dyslexia, find too many colors on a
Web page a major distraction (as do most other users).

Use Intuitive Link Text
***********************

- Create link text that tells users what information they will get by
  selecting the link.
- Avoid "click here".

Why this is important
=====================

All users benefit from easy to scan Web pages with intuitive link text, but for
blind users with screen readers, it is a much more important issue. Screen
readers can be set to scan for links, and skip other content on the page. If
the link text is not intuitive, this setting is useless.
