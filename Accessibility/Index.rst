Welcome to the TYPO3 Accessibility documentation!

Most people today can hardly conceive of life without the internet. It provides
access to news, email, shopping, and entertainment, at any hour of the day or
night. Some have argued that no other single invention has been more
revolutionary since Gutenberg's printing press in the 1400s. Now, at the click
of a mouse, the world can be "at your fingertips"—that is, if you can use a
mouse... and see the screen... and hear the audio—in other words, if you don't
have a disability of any kind.

This document should help you understand how people with disabilities use the
web, the frustrations they feel when they cannot access the web, and what you
can do to make your TYPO3 sites more accessible.
