What is Web Accessibility?
**************************

Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the Web. More
specifically, Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can
perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, and that they can
contribute to the Web. Web accessibility also benefits others, including older
people with changing abilities due to aging.

Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web,
including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological
disabilities.

Millions of people have disabilities that affect their use of the Web. Currently
most Web sites and Web software have accessibility barriers that make it
difficult or impossible for many people with disabilities to use the Web. As
more accessible Web sites and software become available, people with
disabilities are able to use and contribute to the Web more effectively.

Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities. For example, a key
principle of Web accessibility is designing Web sites and software that are
flexible to meet different user needs, preferences, and situations. This
flexibility also benefits people without disabilities in certain situations,
such as people using a slow Internet connection, people with "temporary
disabilities" such as a broken arm, and people with changing abilities due to
aging.

Why Web Accessibility is Important
**********************************

The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life:
education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more.
It is essential that the Web be accessible in order to provide equal access and
equal opportunity to people with disabilities. An accessible Web can also help
people with disabilities more actively participate in society.

The Web offers the possibility of unprecedented access to information and
interaction for many people with disabilities. That is, the accessibility
barriers to print, audio, and visual media can be much more easily overcome
through Web technologies.

Another important consideration for organizations is that Web accessibility is
required by laws and policies in some cases.
